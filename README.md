# stroke-prediction

This was a kaggle project that involved some EDA, data cleaning, and a likelihood prediction of whether or not a new unseen patient was likely to have a stroke or not. I used a heatmap to spot correlations between certain features, some exploratory data analysis by graphing the different features, and in the end used a standard ensemble classifier with sci-kit learn to classify a new patient with their likelihood of having stroke.
